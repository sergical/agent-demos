/**
 * Conversation identity of a turn, keyed by that turn's trace id. A step
 * hook writes the Slack thread when a turn starts; tool code reads it back.
 *
 * The trace id is the only key both sides can agree on: eve restores the
 * turn's span context on every continuation step (`eve.harness.turnTrace` in
 * its tool loop), so one turn is one trace id across all of its steps, and two
 * turns never share one. A Slack turn and a local TUI turn in the same process
 * therefore cannot read each other's entry.
 *
 * The map hangs off globalThis because a Nitro step bundle can inline a second
 * copy of this module; a module-level variable would not be shared with it.
